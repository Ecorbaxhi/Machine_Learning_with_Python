# Machine_Learning_with_Python

In my machine learning coursework, I worked on a Dropout Prediction Challenge, where I built and optimized models to classify students at risk of dropping out. I applied Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Stacked Classifiers, using cross-validation, feature engineering, and F2 score optimization to address class imbalance. 

In another project, I developed a model to predict employee burnout and mental fatigue by applying Linear Regression for continuous fatigue scores and Logistic Regression for binary burnout classification. I explored key predictors such as remote work setup, resource allocation, and job role. Additionally, 

I conducted a comparative evaluation of supervised learning models, including LDA and KNN, analyzing performance using accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrices to guide model selection.
